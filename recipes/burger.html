    <h2>Classic Meal</h2>
    <p>An American Classic, the hamburger consists of a patty of ground beef grilled to perfection which rests between a bun.  It is a basic meal but can become much more complex with the addition of other ingredients such as cheese.  Cheeseburgers can also grow in complexity.  Have you tried lettuce, onion, pickle, or one of the many available sauces?  This simple meal is affordable, fast, customizable, & easy to eat.  It's no wonder it has been a staple of the American diet for decades.</p>
